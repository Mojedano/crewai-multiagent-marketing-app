# CrewAI Multi-Agent Marketing App

A multi-agent LLM application that simulates a SaaS B2B content marketing team using CrewAI.

---

## 🚀 Overview

This project is a **multi-agent LLM application built with CrewAI** that simulates a content marketing team for a SaaS B2B company.

The system coordinates multiple specialized AI agents (strategy, SEO, content, and distribution) to collaboratively generate a structured content marketing plan based on a single business input.

---

## 🧠 Problem & Solution

**Problem:**  
Early-stage SaaS companies often lack the resources to hire a full content marketing team, yet they still need a consistent and strategic content plan.

**Solution:**  
This application replaces a traditional marketing team with a coordinated group of AI agents, each responsible for a specific role, producing a complete and actionable content marketing strategy in seconds.

---

## 🏗 Architecture

The application follows a simple but scalable architecture:

- **CLI interface (`src/app.py`)**: entry point and user interaction
- **CrewAI framework**: orchestrates agents and tasks
- **LLM-powered agents**: each agent has a clear role and goal
- **Notebook version**: exploratory and educational version of the project

The design separates experimentation (notebooks) from production-ready execution (Python scripts).

---

## 🤖 Agents & Responsibilities

The system is composed of multiple specialized agents:

- **Strategy Agent**: defines overall content goals and positioning
- **SEO Agent**: optimizes topics and keywords for search engines
- **Content Agent**: proposes content formats and ideas
- **Distribution Agent**: suggests promotion and distribution channels

All agents collaborate through CrewAI to produce a unified result.

## 🧪 Development Notes

This project was initially developed in a Jupyter Notebook for rapid experimentation.

It was later refactored into a CLI-based Python application for better structure and reusability.

The current architecture is intentionally simple but designed to be easily extended.
